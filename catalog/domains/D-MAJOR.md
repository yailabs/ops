# YAI - Macro Domains (D-Major)

This document defines the nine macro domains used to drive YAI's cross-domain coherence.

The purpose of D-Major is simple: prove that YAI is an infrastructure layer, not a single vertical tool.
YAI must preserve a single runtime grammar across domains:

trigger -> context -> authority/contract -> decision -> enforcement -> evidence

What changes across domains is the semantics, captured through Domain Packs.

## D1) Digital Domain (Compute & Information)

Everything natively made of bits: compute, storage, networking, protocols, distributed systems, software supply chain, APIs, runtimes.

Typical events:
- message ingress, RPC frames, state commits
- network connections, provider calls
- filesystem reads/writes, database queries
- build/release actions, dependency changes

Why it matters:
This domain is the closest to the runtime's native control surface. It is typically the first domain used for qualification (e.g., SC-102 core-only).

## D2) Physical Domain (Matter, Energy, Space-Time)

Systems where actions move matter/energy and are constrained by physics: sensors/actuators, cyber-physical systems, vehicles, robotics, industrial control, energy, avionics/space.

Typical events:
- telemetry and sensor readings
- actuator commands, safety interlocks
- physical faults, degradation, environmental latency

Why it matters:
Enforcement can have immediate real-world consequences. Domain semantics must capture safety windows, interlocks, and fail-closed boundaries.

## D3) Biological Domain (Life)

Clinical, biotech, wet-lab processes, bioinformatics, ecosystems.

Typical events:
- measurements, lab protocols, sample handling
- consent capture, chain-of-custody updates
- results, transformations, dataset access

Why it matters:
Authority and evidence must support consent and chain-of-custody constraints, not just access control.

## D4) Social-Institutional Domain (People & Institutions)

People, institutions, and procedures: law, public administration, governance, regulation, education, labor, welfare.

Typical events:
- formal acts, procedural steps, approvals
- access requests, delegations, notifications
- disputes, accountability events

Why it matters:
The semantics are procedural: a decision is not only allowed/denied but must be tied to roles, duties, and procedural legitimacy.

## D5) Economic Domain (Value & Exchange)

Finance, credit, payments, insurance, contracts, procurement, markets.

Typical events:
- authorization/denial, scoring, holds/releases
- transactions, settlement steps, contractual conditions
- disputes and reversals

Why it matters:
This domain is strict about limits, counterparties, and contractual scope. Decisions must be stable and explainable, and evidence must support audit and dispute resolution.

## D6) Operational Domain (Coordination & Logistics)

Coordination of complex systems: logistics, planning, maintenance, incident response, SRE/ops, emergencies.

Typical events:
- scheduling, prioritization, allocation
- rerouting, failover, recovery actions
- escalation and post-incident evidence

Why it matters:
This is where time-to-action becomes money. Domain packs must define what actions require arming/escalation and what can be automated safely.

## D7) Cognitive-Cultural Domain (Meaning & Media)

Meaning, content, and cultural dynamics: media, communication, reputation, moderation, knowledge operations.

Typical events:
- publication/visibility changes, ranking decisions
- enforcement actions, access restrictions
- provenance checks, appeals/contestation

Why it matters:
Semantics revolve around provenance, policy compliance, and contestability. Evidence must make decisions auditable and explainable.

## D8) Scientific Domain (Knowledge & Measurement)

Science as a chain of measurements and transformations: experiments, simulations, pipelines, reproducibility.

Typical events:
- data acquisition, preprocessing, exclusions
- parameter declarations, transformations
- results publication with evidence

Why it matters:
Reproducibility is a core constraint. Domain packs must define parameter locks, provenance, and evidence that supports repeatability.

## D9) Environmental / Climatological Domain (Earth Systems)

Environmental and climatological systems where information is produced by measurement and models across space-time:
environment monitoring, climate analytics, emissions tracking, hazard detection, early warning systems.

Typical events:
- sensor telemetry ingestion (air quality, temperature, water levels, radiation)
- calibration updates, station integrity checks
- derived metrics (AQI, anomaly scores), threshold crossings
- model runs/forecasts with parameter sets
- publication of alerts, bulletins, and regulatory reports

Why it matters:
This domain is high-stakes and multi-scale: small data integrity failures can cascade into wrong operational decisions or compliance exposure.
Domain semantics must enforce measurement integrity (calibration, provenance) and reproducibility (parameter locks) while minimizing disclosure (e.g., do not leak sensitive location data).

## Cross-Domain Coherence Note (SC-102 alignment)

SC-102 (core-only qualification) should demonstrate that the following invariants remain identical across all D-Major domains (D1-D9):

- authority envelope integrity
- policy/contract chain (baseline hashable)
- decision vocabulary stability (allow/deny/quarantine/rate_limit)
- fail-closed behavior for forbidden effects
- evidence pack completeness and replayability
- minimal disclosure (only necessary information emitted)

Only the domain semantics should change (via Domain Packs), not the runtime.

## Domain Packs (reference)

Domain packs are defined under:
`docs/30-catalog/domains/packs/<Dk>/<pack-id>/`

Each pack should declare:
- forbidden effects (domain semantics)
- expected reason codes
- required evidence fields and KPIs
- baselines (allow/deny/quarantine)
- safe vectors (stimuli) and expected outcomes
